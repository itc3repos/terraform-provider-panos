# panos_address_group

This resource allows you to add/update/delete address groups.

Address groups are either statically defined or dynamically defined, so only
`static_addresses` or `dynamic_match` should be defined within a given address
group.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Static group
resource "panos_address_group" "example1" {
    name = "static ntp grp"
    description = "My NTP servers"
    static_addresses = ["ntp1", "ntp2", "ntp3"]
}

# Dynamic group
resource "panos_address_group" "example2" {
    name = "dynamic grp"
    description = "My internal NTP servers"
    dynamic_match = "'internal' and 'ntp'"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The address group's name.
